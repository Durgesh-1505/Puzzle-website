          A light bulb is hanging in a room. Outside of the room, there are
          three switches, of which only one is connected to the lamp. In the
          starting situation, all switches are 'off' and the bulb is not lit. If
          it is allowed to check in the room only once to see if the bulb is lit
          or not (this is not visible from the outside), how can you determine
          with which of the three switches the light bulb can be switched on?

          Tom has three boxes with fruits in his barn: one box with apples, one
          box with pears, and one box with both apples and pears. The boxes have
          labels that describe the contents, but none of these labels is on the
          right box. How can Tom determine what each of the boxes contains, by
          taking only one piece of fruit from one box?

          Assume that you have a number of long fuses, of which you only know
          that they burn for exactly one hour after you lighted them at one end.
          However, you do not know whether they burn with constant speed, so the
          first half of the fuse can be burnt in only ten minutes while the rest
          takes the other fifty minutes to burn completely. Also, assume that
          you have a lighter. How can you measure exactly three quarters of an
          hour with these fuses?

          On the right, you see a paper with a chessboard print on it. We want
          to cut the chessboard paper into pieces (over the lines!) such that
          each piece has twice as much squares of one color than of the other
          color (i.e. twice as much black squares as white squares or twice as
          much white squares as black squares). Is it possible to do this? Give
          a proof!

          Try to fill the total board below (10 by 10, without two opposite
          corner squares) with bricks of size 2 (Puzzle and Puzzle), so no
          overlaps, no gaps, and no bricks crossing the borders. Is it possible
          to do this? (Proof!)
