          The total number of toes is 5170.<br />

          The puppies: 4 children × 4 backpacks × 4 dogs × 4 puppies × 4 legs ×
          4 toes = 4096<br />
          Plus the dogs: 4 children × 4 backpacks × 4 dogs × 4 legs × 4 toes =
          1024<br />
          Plus the children: 4 children × 2 legs × 5 toes = 40<br />
          Plus the driver of the school bus: 2 legs × 5 toes = 10<br />
          <br />
          This gives the following total number of toes: 5170

          Let n be the number of chickens and let d be the number of days in
          which Charlie will run out of chicken-food with this number of
          chickens. The total amount of chicken-food always equals the number of
          chickens multiplied by the number of days the food lasts. Therefore,
          the total amount of chicken-food equals n × d. If Charlie would sell
          75 of his chickens, he could feed the remaining chickens twenty days
          longer, so the total amount of chicken-food would then equal<br />

          ( n - 75 ) × ( d + 20 ).<br />
          But the total amount of chicken-food does not change, so<br />

          ( n - 75 ) × ( d + 20 ) = n × d<br />
          which can be rewritten to equation 1:<br />

          d = 4/15 × n - 20.<br />
          If Charlie would buy 100 extra chickens, he would run out of
          chicken-food fifteen days earlier, so the total amount of chicken-food
          would then equal<br />

          ( n + 100 ) × ( d - 15 ).<br />
          But the total amount of chicken-food does not change, so<br />

          ( n + 100 ) × ( d - 15 ) = n × d<br />
          which can be rewritten to equation 2:<br />

          d = 3/20 × n + 15.<br />
          Combining equations 1 and 2 gives:<br />

          4/15 × n - 20 = 3/20 × n + 15.<br />
          Solving this equations gives n = 300, so farmer Charlie has 300
          chickens.

          1 chicken lays 2 eggs in 3 days, so 3 chickens lay 3×2=6 eggs in 3
          days. In 9 days, these 3 chickens lay 3 times as much eggs as in 3
          days. Conclusion: three chickens lay 3×6=18 eggs in nine days.

          Call the requested width of the river r.<br />

          The first time that Patrick and Eric meet, the total distance that
          they have traveled together equals the width of the river, or r. The
          second time that Patrick and Eric meet, the total distance that they
          have traveled together equals twice the width of the river plus the
          width of the river, so 3 × r. Because Patrick and Eric row with a
          constant speed, it also holds that the distance that Patrick traveled
          in total at the second meeting, equals 3 times the distance that
          Patrick traveled in total at the first meeting.
          <br />
          The distance that Patrick traveled in total at the first meeting is
          180. The distance that Patrick traveled in total at the second meeting
          is r + 100. When we combine the above, we get the following
          equation:<br />

          3 × 180 = r + 100.<br />
          When we solve this equation we find that r = 440.<br />

          Therefore, the river is 440 meters wide.

          If you have written down a full paper of mathematical formulas, you
          have not been thinking in the right direction.<br />

          It is obvious that the two cars meet each other after one hour. On
          that moment, the bird has flown for one hour.<br />

        </p>
        <br><br>
        <h2 class="heading">Conclusion:<span> The bird has flown
          80 km/h × 1 h = 80 km.</span></h2>
