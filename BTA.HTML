            <div class="content"><p>To find the correct switch (1, 2, or 3), turn switch 1 to 'on' and leave it like that for a few minutes. After that,
                you turn switch 1 back to 'off', and turn switch 2 to 'on'. Now enter the room. If the light bulb is lit, then you know that 
                switch 2 is connected to it. If the bulb is not lit, then it has to be switch 1 or 3. Now touching for short the light bulb, will
                 give you the answer: if the bulb is still hot, then switch 1 was the correct one; if the bulb is cold, then it has to be switch 
                 3.

        <div class="content"><p>Tom takes a piece of fruit from the box with the labels 'Apples and Pears'. If it is an apple, then the label
             'Apples' belongs to this box. The box that said 'Apples', then of course should not be labeled 'Apples and Pears', because that would 
             mean that the box with 'Pears' would have been labeled correctly, and this is contradictory to the fact that none of the labels was 
             correct. On the box with the label 'Apples' should be the label 'Pears'. If Tom had taken a pear, the reasoning would have been in a 
             similar way.

        <div class="content" style="height:200px"><p>With only two fuses that burn exactly one hour, one can measure three quarters of an hour accurately, by lighting 
            the first fuse at both ends and the other fuse at one end simultaneously. When the first fuse is burnt out after exactly half an hour 
            (!) you know that the second fuse still has exactly half an hour to go before it will be burnt completely, but we do not wait for 
            that. We now also light the other end of the second fuse. This means that the second fuse will now be burnt completely after another 
            quarter of an hour, which adds up to exactly three quarters of an hour since we started lighting the first fuse!

        <div class="content" style="height:200px"><p>No, it is not possible to cut the chessboard paper into pieces such that each piece has
             twice as much squares of one color than of the other color. If it would be possible, then every piece would have a number of squares 
             divisible by 3 (because if a piece has n squares of one color and 2×n squares of the other color, it has 3×n squares in total). The 
             total number of squares of all pieces would then also be divisible by 3. This is, however, impossible since the total number of
              squares on the chessboard is 64, which is not divisible by 3.

        <div class="content" style="height:200px"><p>Imagine the board to be colored like a chessboard. Each brick will cover a white and a black 
            square of the board, so the number of bricks equals the number of white squares equals the number of black squares. However, by 
            removing the two opposite corners of the chessboard (with an even numbers of rows and columns), two squares of the same color are 
            removed, so there is an imbalance of white and black squares.<br>
