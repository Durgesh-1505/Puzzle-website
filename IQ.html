           <p> Farmer Charlie has a chicken farm. On a certain day, Charlie calculates in how many days he will run out of chicken-food. He 
            notices that if he would sell 75 of his chickens, he could feed the remaining chickens twenty days longer with the chicken-food he 
            has, and that if he would buy 100 extra chickens, he would run out of chicken-food fifteen days earlier.

           <p> Patrick and Eric are on the two opposite banks of a river. They both have a rowing boat.

            They both start at the same time towards the opposite bank. They pass each other at 180 meters from the bank where Patrick departed. When reaching the opposite bank, they both take a rest for the same amount of time before they return. On the way back, they pass each other at 100 meters from the bank from where Patrick returned.
            
            Patrick and Eric both row with a constant speed, but Eric rows faster.

           <p> Consider a road with two cars, at a distance of 100 kilometers, driving towards each other. The left car drives at a speed of forty
             kilometers per hour and the right car at a speed of sixty kilometers per hour. A bird starts at the same location as the right car 
             and flies at a speed of 80 kilometers per hour. When it reaches the left car, it turns its direction, and when it reaches the right
              car, it turns its direction again to the opposite, etcetera.<br>
